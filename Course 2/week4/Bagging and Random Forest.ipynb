Мы предлагаем использовать k=10, чтобы полученные оценки качества имели небольшой разброс, и было проще проверить полученные ответы. На практике же часто хватает и k=5. Функция cross_val_score будет возвращать numpy.ndarray, в котором будет k чисел - качество в каждом из k экспериментов k-fold cross validation. Для получения среднего значения (которое и будет оценкой качества работы) вызовите метод .mean() у массива, который возвращает cross_val_score.\n",

Если это не помогает, то где-то была допущена ошибка.\n",

    "Если вам захочется ускорить вычисление cross_val_score - можете попробовать использовать параметр n_jobs, но будьте осторожны: в одной из старых версий sklearn была ошибка, которая приводила к неверному результату работы cross_val_score при задании n_jobs отличным от 1. Сейчас такой проблемы возникнуть не должно, но проверить, что все в порядке, не будет лишним."

    "Наконец, давайте попробуем выбирать случайные признаки не один раз на все дерево, а при построении каждой вершины дерева. Сделать это несложно: нужно убрать выбор случайного подмножества признаков в BaggingClassifier и добавить его в DecisionTreeClassifier. Какой параметр за это отвечает, можно понять из документации sklearn, либо просто попробовать угадать (скорее всего, у вас сразу получится). Попробуйте выбирать опять же d√ признаков. Качество полученного классификатора на контрольной выборке и будет ответом в пункте 4."

    "Полученный в пункте 4 классификатор - бэггинг на рандомизированных деревьях (в которых при построении каждой вершины выбирается случайное подмножество признаков и разбиение ищется только по ним). Это в точности соответствует алгоритму Random Forest, поэтому почему бы не сравнить качество работы классификатора с RandomForestClassifier из sklearn.ensemble. Сделайте это, а затем изучите, как качество классификации на данном датасете зависит от количества деревьев, количества признаков, выбираемых при построении каждой вершины дерева, а также ограничений на глубину дерева. Для наглядности лучше построить графики зависимости качества от значений параметров, но для сдачи задания это делать не обязательно.\n",
